        <p class="subtitle">Analyzing UDISE+ Data to Uncover Inequalities in Access and Outcomes</p>
    </header>

    <div class="intro">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project examines educational disparities across India using data from UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education Plus) and other sources. Through a series of data visualizations, we explore patterns of inequality across geographic, gender, and socioeconomic dimensions to understand the challenges facing India's education system.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong> How do enrollment rates vary across Indian states? What gender disparities exist in education access? How do rural and urban areas compare in educational outcomes?</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chart 1: Gender Gap by State -->
    <section>
        <h2>Gender Gap in School Enrollment</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>This diverging bar chart reveals significant gender disparities in school enrollment across Indian states. The horizontal bars show the percentage point difference between girls' and boys' enrollment rates. States like Haryana and Punjab show substantial gaps favoring boys (green bars extending left), indicating fewer girls enrolled relative to boys. In contrast, southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu approach gender parity or show slight advantages for girls (purple bars extending right).</p>
            
            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Northern states exhibit the most pronounced gender gaps (up to 7 percentage points), while southern and northeastern states demonstrate greater gender parity in education access. Use the year slider to observe how these patterns have evolved from 2022 to 2024.

    <section>
        <h2>Educational Progression and Dropout Patterns</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>This visualization examines enrollment patterns by gender across different states, revealing where students are concentrated in the education system and how gender ratios vary by region. The chart allows comparison of boys' and girls' enrollment numbers across states, highlighting both absolute enrollment levels and gender balance.</p>
            
            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Large populous states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal dominate enrollment numbers in absolute terms, but the gender composition varies significantly. States with higher overall enrollment don't necessarily have better gender parity—some high-enrollment states still show substantial gender gaps, while smaller states may achieve better balance.

    <!-- Chart 3: Rural vs Urban Educational Access -->
    <section>
        <h2>School Type Distribution: Rural vs Urban Divide</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>This area chart reveals stark differences in school type distribution between rural and urban areas across India. The visualization shows what percentage of total enrollment each school type (State Government, Central Government, Government Aided, Private Unaided, and Other) comprises in rural versus urban settings from 2021-2024.</p>
            
            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Rural areas remain heavily dominated by state government schools (approximately 65% of enrollment), while urban areas show a much more diverse landscape with private unaided schools comprising nearly 60% of enrollment. This disparity highlights the urban-rural divide in school choice and access to private education.
            </div>
            
            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <strong>Urban Trend:</strong> Private unaided schools have grown from about 65% to 73% of urban enrollment between 2021-2024, suggesting increasing privatization of urban education. In contrast, rural private school enrollment has remained relatively stable at around 25%.
            </div>
            
            <p>Use the state dropdown to explore variations across different states. Some states show dramatically different patterns—certain urban areas have almost entirely privatized, while others maintain stronger government school systems.</p>

    <!-- Chart 4: School Infrastructure by State -->
    <section>
        <h2>School Infrastructure Quality Across States</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>This choropleth map visualizes the composite infrastructure index across Indian states for 2022-2024. The index combines four key metrics: electricity availability, internet connectivity, library access, and functional girls' toilets. Darker shades of green indicate better infrastructure, while lighter shades reveal states with significant infrastructure gaps.</p>
            
            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> A clear geographic pattern emerges, with southern states (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana) and western states (Gujarat, Maharashtra) showing infrastructure scores above 80%, while several northeastern states lag behind with scores below 50%. This geographic pattern suggests systematic regional disparities in educational investment and development.
            </div>
            
            <p>The map reveals that infrastructure quality does not perfectly predict learning outcomes (as shown in our correlation analysis below). States like Himachal Pradesh achieve excellent learning outcomes despite moderate infrastructure scores, while some well-resourced states show lower student performance—suggesting that how resources are used matters as much as their availability.</p>

    <!-- Chart 5: State-wise Literacy Rates -->
    <section>
        <h2>Learning Outcomes Across Standards and States</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>This dual heatmap displays proficiency levels in reading and mathematics across three critical grade levels—Standard III, V, and VIII—for all major Indian states. The data comes from ASER 2024 (Annual Status of Education Report), which tests foundational competencies: reading comprehension at Standard II level for the reading assessment, and mathematical ability to perform subtraction (Std III) or division (Std V & VIII) for the math assessment.</p>
            
            <div class="key-finding">
                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> A clear performance hierarchy emerges across states. Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Punjab, and Kerala consistently achieve the highest proficiency rates (70-90% at Std VIII for reading), while states like Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu show concerning patterns with less than 35% of Std V students achieving basic reading competency. The math proficiency crisis is even more severe—most states show fewer than 40% of Std V students able to perform basic division.
            </div>
            
            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <strong>The Learning Crisis:</strong> Even at Standard VIII (equivalent to 8th grade), states like Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir show reading proficiency rates below 66%, meaning one-third of eighth graders cannot read a second-grade level text. For mathematics, the situation is starker—states like Gujarat, Assam, and Meghalaya have division proficiency rates below 30% at Std VIII.
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Notable Patterns:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Progressive vs. Stagnant Learning:</strong> Reading proficiency generally improves substantially from Std III to Std VIII (gains of 30-50 percentage points), but mathematical proficiency shows much smaller gains (10-20 points), suggesting mathematics instruction faces unique systemic challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Subject Disparities:</strong> Most states perform relatively better in reading than in mathematics. For instance, Haryana shows 82.7% reading proficiency at Std VIII but only 56.4% for division—a 26-point gap.</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Patterns:</strong> Northern states (Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana) and northeastern states (Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim) outperform the national average, while several southern states surprisingly lag despite better infrastructure.</li>

        <h2>Infrastructure & Class Size: Do They Matter for Learning?</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>We examine whether better school infrastructure and lower student-teacher ratios correlate with improved learning outcomes across Indian states. Surprisingly, the data reveals weak correlations, suggesting that simply investing in facilities or reducing class sizes does not automatically translate to better educational results.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Neither infrastructure quality nor student-teacher ratios show significant correlation with learning outcomes (all r < 0.22, p > 0.28). States with the highest infrastructure scores do not necessarily achieve the best results, pointing to other factors—such as teacher quality, curriculum effectiveness, and socioeconomic conditions—as more critical determinants of educational success.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p>The data reveals persistent educational disparities across India's states, with significant variations in gender parity, rural-urban access, and enrollment across social categories. Addressing these inequalities requires targeted policy interventions that account for regional differences and systemic barriers to education access.</p>
